degree_vector # vector of individual node degrees
eligible # vector of nodes that are still in the graph. True or False at indexes

while degree_vector is not zero vector:
	parent is the node with the highest degree
	while degree of parent is not zero:
		if the parent is in the graph:
			select child not yet in graph
			change status of child
		else
			select child in graph
			change status of parent
		make connection in graph
		subtract 1 from both parent and child degree
